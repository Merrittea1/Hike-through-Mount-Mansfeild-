## A Hike through Mount Mansfeild Natural Area

### Introduction
This webmap provides a hiking route from the Laura Cowles trailhead to the Mount Mansfeild Visitor Center at the nose of the mountain. You will hike through switchbakcs up to cantilever rock. Following this, the route takes hikers through to the Mount Mansfeild peak or you they have the choice to take the Canyon Extension trail to the Mount Mansfeild Visitor Center.

### Major functions
This map includes a zoom feature that allows both zoom in and out. The basemap is dynamic and the image changes based on your zoom level. The title and the description box are stagnant, but provide a working link to the website where the text was provided. Lastly, the labels for the notable features of the trail are interactive so when you pan your mouse over the place marker the name will pop up, and then dissapear upon movement of your mouse off the marker.

### Libraries and Data Sources
There is a GPX file as well as geoJSON file to code for the map coordinates. I used a basemap from the leaflet library named 'CyclOSM'.
The coordinates data was found from creating a route on google maps and then converting the data into a GPX file and later into a geoJSON. My description was sourced from Summitpost.org, which explains Mount Mansfeild in detail.
